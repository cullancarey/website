				<h2>My Projects</h2>
				<p>Welcome to my projects page. This page contains information about some personal projects I have
					created. Creating projects like this is a hobby of mine. I enjoy working with and learning about new
					technologies. I am inspired to create things I can share with family and friends. It gives me the
					motivation to see the project all the way through. I am proud of the projects below, and they are
					worth sharing. They are not perfect, but what is? I'll continue to improve them. I am always open to
					feedback. You can reach me via <a href="mailto: cullancarey@gmail.com" target="_blank">email</a>.
					The projects on this page and others are all hosted on my <a href="https://github.com/cullancarey"
						target="_blank">Github</a>.</p>

		<!-- About Section -->
		<section id="about">
			<div class="container">
				<h3>About this website</h3>
				<p>First, I did not write the code that drives what you see on this website. I am not a website
					developer, so I used a template from <a href="http://html5up.net" target="_blank">HTML5 UP</a> and
					filled in the necessary details. I did, however, build the infrastructure using Amazon Web Services.
					Cullancarey.com is a static AWS S3 website fronted by Cloudfront. Please see the architecture
					diagram below.</p>
				<figure class="image arch">
					<img src="images/cullancarey-website-architecture.png" alt="Website architecture diagram">
				</figure>
				<p>This website is highly available. The main website bucket replicates to the failover bucket in a
					different region. Access to the S3 bucket is restricted to the Cloudfront OAI. All code is available
					for viewing in the <a href="https://github.com/cullancarey/website" target="_blank">GitHub
						repository</a>. Building cullancarey.com was a fun project and a valuable experience.</p>
				<h3>Deployment Automation</h3>
				<p>The automation for this repo's deployment utilized a Cloudformation StackSet set up for my aws
					organization. My <a href="https://github.com/cullancarey/aws_deployment_roles"
						target="_blank">aws_deployment-roles</a> repo holds CDK code which defines the Cloudformation
					stack set that deploys the deployment roles to the member accounts of my organization. I have
					created an OIDC GitHub Actions user in my management account. The actions first assume this role and
					then use this role to assume the deployment roles in the member accounts. Below is a diagram showing
					the flow of this architecture.</p>

		<!-- Terraform Section -->
		<section id="terraform">
			<div class="container">
				<h3>AWS S3 Static Website Terraform Module</h3>
				<p>For this project I created a Terraform module that will deploy a static website using AWS S3 and
					Cloudfront. The website is configured to be highly available utilizing two S3 buckets in different
					regions. Access to the S3 bucket is restricted to the Cloudfront OAI. Please see the architecture
					diagram below.
				<figure class="image arch2">
					<img src="images/s3_static_website_arch.png" alt="S3 static website architecture diagram">
				</figure>
				I published this module to the Terraform registry, it is available under the name <a
					href="https://registry.terraform.io/modules/cullancarey/static-s3-website-template/aws/latest"
					target="_blank">static-s3-website-template</a>. It has over 1200 downloads! Further details and the
				code itself is available for viewing in the <a href="https://github.com/cullancarey/website"
					target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>.</p>

		<!-- Youtube Video Generator Section -->
		<section id="youtube">
			<div class="container">
				<h3>Youtube Video Generator</h3>
				<p>I was looking to improve various areas of my skillset in this project and hit all my areas of
					interest. I wanted to create something I could share with friends and family! I was doing some
					research and came across <a href="https://blog.sudcha.com/about" target="_blank">Sudeep
						Chauhan's</a> <a href="https://blog.sudcha.com/i-made-youtube-videos-using-python/"
						target="_blank">blog post</a> about automating the creation of Youtube videos, and I thought it
					was a great idea. At the end of the post, he specifies people are free to use it, so I wanted to see
					if I could tweak it and create my version of his idea. See an example video below.</p>
				<iframe width="600" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2zIzOtzVBCk" title="Daily Quote"
					frameborder="0"
					allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
					allowfullscreen></iframe>
				<p>This program first scrapes Reddit r/quotes for the newest SFW post on the page. It then writes that
					quote to a text file and, using tts, creates an audio file of the quote. Next, it will do a google
					image search based on the text file to retrieve relevant images for the video. After that, it will
					create the video file using FFmpeg. Finally, it will call the upload_video.py file provided by
					Youtube <a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/guides/uploading_a_video"
						target="_blank">here</a>. The video will appear on my <a
						href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGU6cW0iBDA0N3D6iHcc5zg" target="_blank">Youtube
						channel</a> every day at 10 am EST.</p>

				<p>The second part of the project tweets about the videos. It retrieves to most recent upload to the
					Youtube channel and tweets about the video to the <a href="https://twitter.com/VideosByPython"
						target="_blank">Twitter account</a> I created for it. The tweets contain the video title, link
					to the Youtube channel, link directly to the video, and the exact time of the tweet. See an example
					<a href="https://twitter.com/VideosByPython/status/1585318022528598016?cxt=HHwWgIC8zfKVl4AsAAAA"
						target="_blank">here</a>.

				<h3>Website Infra CDK</h3>
				<p>I enjoy all things IaC and wanted to experience a different IaC technology. I decided to build a
					replica of my website infrastructure in AWS using the Python CDK. Creating this replica of my
					website infrastructure was a great opportunity to learn another popular tool and further my Python
					skills. The CDK code is held in the repository for this project under the <a
						href="https://github.com/cullancarey/website_cdk/tree/main/site_stacks"
						target="_blank">site_stacks</a> directory. Further details and the code are available for
					viewing in the <a href="https://github.com/cullancarey/website_cdk" target="_blank">GitHub
						repository</a>.</p>
