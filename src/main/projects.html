						<h2>My Projects</h2>
						<p>Inspiration</p>
					</header>
					<p>Welcome to my projects page. This page contains information about some personal projects I have
						created. Creating projects like this is a hobby of mine. I enjoy working with and learning about
						new technologies. I am inspired to create things I can share with family and friends. It gives
						me the motivation to see the project all the way through. I am proud of the projects below, and
						they are worth sharing. They are not perfect, but what is? I'll continue to improve them. I am
						always open to feedback. You can reach me via <a href="mailto: cullancarey@gmail.com"
							target="_blank">email</a>. The projects on this page and others are all hosted on my <a
							href="https://github.com/cullancarey" target="_blank">Github</a>.</p>

					<h3>About this website</h3>
					<p>First, I did not write the code that drives what you see on this website. I am not a website
						developer, so I used a template from <a href="http://html5up.net" target="_blank">HTML5 UP</a>
						and filled in the necessary details. I did, however, build the infrastructure using Amazon Web
						Services. Cullancarey.com is a static AWS S3 website fronted by Cloudfront. Please see the
						architecture diagram below.
					<div class="image arch">
						<img src="images/cullancarey-website-architecture.png" alt="" />
					</div>
					This website is highly available. The main website bucket replicates to the failover bucket in a
					different region. Access to the S3 bucket is restricted to the Cloudfront OAI. All code is available
					for viewing in the <a href="https://github.com/cullancarey/website" target="_blank">GitHub
						repository</a>. Building cullancarey.com was a fun project and a valuable experience.</p>
					<h3>Deployment Automation</h3>
					<p>The automation for this repo's deployment utilized a Cloudformation StackSet set up for my aws
						organization. My <a href="https://github.com/cullancarey/aws_deployment_roles"
							target="_blank">aws_deployment-roles</a> repo holds CDK code which defines the
						Cloudformation stack set that deploys the deployment roles to the member accounts of my
						organization. I have created an OIDC GitHub Actions user in my management account. The actions
						first assume this role and then use this role to assume the deployment roles in the member
						accounts. Below is a diagram showing the flow of this architecture.

					<h3>AWS S3 Static Website Terraform Module</h3>
					<p>For this project I created a Terraform module that will deploy a static website using AWS S3 and
						Cloudfront. The website is configured to be highly available utilizing two S3 buckets in
						different regions. Access to the S3 bucket is restricted to the Cloudfront OAI. Please see the
						architecture diagram below.
					<div class="image arch2">
						<img src="images/s3_static_website_arch.png" alt="" />
					</div>
					I published this module to the Terraform registry, it is available under the name <a
						href="https://registry.terraform.io/modules/cullancarey/static-s3-website-template/aws/latest"
						target="_blank">static-s3-website-template</a>. It has over 800 downloads! Further details and
					the code itself is available for viewing in the <a href="https://github.com/cullancarey/website"
						target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>.</p>

					<h3>Youtube Video Generator</h3>
					<p>I was looking to improve various areas of my skillset in this project and hit all my areas of
						interest. I wanted to create something I could share with friends and family! I was doing some
						research and came across <a href="https://blog.sudcha.com/about" target="_blank">Sudeep
							Chauhan's</a> <a href="https://blog.sudcha.com/i-made-youtube-videos-using-python/"
							target="_blank">blog post</a> about automating the creation of Youtube videos, and I thought
						it was a great idea. At the end of the post, he specifies people are free to use it, so I wanted
						to see if I could tweak it and create my version of his idea. See an example video below.</p>
					<iframe width="600" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2zIzOtzVBCk" title="Daily Quote"
						frameborder="0"
						allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
						allowfullscreen></iframe>
					<p>This program first scrapes Reddit r/quotes for the newest SFW post on the page. It then writes
						that quote to a text file and, using tts, creates an audio file of the quote. Next, it will do a
						google image search based on the text file to retrieve relevant images for the video. After
						that, it will create the video file using FFmpeg. Finally, it will call the upload_video.py file
						provided by Youtube <a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/guides/uploading_a_video"
							target="_blank">here</a>. The video will appear on my <a
							href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGU6cW0iBDA0N3D6iHcc5zg" target="_blank">Youtube
							channel</a> every day at 10 am EST.</p>

					<p>The second part of the project tweets about the videos. It retrieves to most recent upload to the
						Youtube channel and tweets about the video to the <a href="https://twitter.com/VideosByPython"
							target="_blank">Twitter account</a> I created for it. The tweets contain the video title,
						link to the Youtube channel, link directly to the video, and the exact time of the tweet. See an
						example <a
							href="https://twitter.com/VideosByPython/status/1585318022528598016?cxt=HHwWgIC8zfKVl4AsAAAA"
							target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

					<h3>Website Infra CDK</h3>
					<p>I enjoy all things IaC and wanted to experience a different IaC technology. I decided to build a
						replica of my website infrastructure in AWS using the Python CDK. Creating this replica of my
						website infrastructure was a great opportunity to learn another popular tool and further my
						Python skills. The CDK code is held in the repository for this project under the <a
							href="https://github.com/cullancarey/website_cdk/tree/main/site_stacks"
							target="_blank">site_stacks</a> directory. Further details and the code are available for
						viewing in the <a href="https://github.com/cullancarey/website_cdk" target="_blank">GitHub
							repository</a>.</p>
